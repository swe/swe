### 👋

🚀 Hello nice people! I’m a tech geek with a 5+ year work experience in the tech sector, where I’ve work as a Security Engineer.
 
📍 My home town is Stockholm, I live here and hike with my dog. I have international work experience from EU, Russia, USA and the UK.

💻 Most of the time I'm writing on С/С++. Sometimes Go or Vue.js, when I need to

🏛 More than tech guy, I am a passionate entrpreuner and I started an Expatriate Club at Stockholm, to unite and help people with assimilating in Sweden.

🐶 I have few pet projects, but not sure if I want to talk about them before they started :)

📫 If you want to know me closer, just message me on hello@alleksy.com

📝 CV? Later
