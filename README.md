### 👋

🚀 Hello nice people! I’m a tech geek with a 5+ year work experience in the tech sector, where I’ve work as a Principle Security Engineer.
 
📍 My home town is Stockholm, where I live and hike. Collected international work experience from EU, Russia, USA and the UK.

💻 Most of the time I'm writing on С/С++ and Python. Sometimes Go or Vue.js, when I need to

🏛 More than tech guy, I am a passionate entrpreuner and I started an Expatriate Club at Stockholm, to unite and help people with assimilating in Sweden.

🐶 I have few pet projects, and one of them is "12 in 12". I am going to start 12 projects (small or huge) in 12 months. Started on February 1st, 2022
